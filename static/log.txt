Alright! Let's bake a cake! Since you haven't specified any particular kind, let's start with a classic: a **Vanilla Butter Cake**. This recipe is versatile and can be easily adapted for different flavors later.

**Vanilla Butter Cake Recipe**

This recipe assumes you have basic baking equipment like a stand mixer (or hand mixer), measuring cups and spoons, mixing bowls, a whisk, a spatula, and cake pans.

**Yields:** 8-10 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes
**Bake time:** 30-35 minutes

**Ingredients:**

*   **For the Cake:**
    *   2 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour (see note below for gluten-free)
    *   2 teaspoons baking powder
    *   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
    *   1/2 teaspoon salt
    *   1 cup (2 sticks, 227g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
    *   1 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar
    *   2 large eggs + 2 egg yolks, at room temperature
    *   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    *   1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature (see substitute below)

*   **For a Simple Vanilla Buttercream Frosting (Optional):**
    *   1 cup (2 sticks, 227g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
    *   3-4 cups (360-480g) powdered sugar, sifted
    *   1/4 cup (60ml) milk or heavy cream
    *   1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Equipment:**

*   9-inch round cake pans (2) - You can also use an 8-inch, but baking time might need to be adjusted.
*   Parchment paper
*   Mixing bowls (at least 3)
*   Electric mixer (stand or hand-held)
*   Rubber spatula
*   Measuring cups and spoons
*   Wire rack

**Instructions:**

**1. Prepare the Pans & Oven:**

*   Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
*   Grease the cake pans with butter or cooking spray.
*   Cut out parchment paper circles the size of the bottom of the cake pans. Place the parchment circles into the pans. This will help prevent sticking.  You can also grease and flour the pans instead, if you prefer.

**2. Combine Dry Ingredients:**

*   In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Whisking is important to evenly distribute the leavening agents (baking powder and baking soda).  Set aside.

**3. Cream Butter and Sugar:**

*   In a large bowl (or the bowl of your stand mixer), cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This usually takes 3-5 minutes on medium speed.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.  This step is crucial for incorporating air into the batter, which makes the cake light and tender.

**4. Add Eggs and Vanilla:**

*   Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the egg yolks.  Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.
*   Stir in the vanilla extract.

**5. Alternate Dry and Wet Ingredients:**

*   Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients.  This means:
    *   Add about 1/3 of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
    *   Add 1/2 of the buttermilk and mix until just combined.
    *   Add another 1/3 of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
    *   Add the remaining buttermilk and mix until just combined.
    *   Add the final 1/3 of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
*   Be careful not to overmix the batter. Overmixing develops the gluten in the flour, leading to a tough cake. Mix until *just* combined.

**6. Pour and Bake:**

*   Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.
*   Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
*   If the top of the cake starts to brown too quickly, you can lightly tent the pans with foil.

**7. Cool and Frost (Optional):**

*   Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10-15 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely.
*   While the cakes are cooling, make the frosting (if desired).
    *   In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter until smooth.
    *   Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, mixing on low speed until combined.
    *   Add the milk or cream and vanilla extract. Beat on high speed until light and fluffy. Add more milk or cream if the frosting is too thick, and more powdered sugar if it is too thin.
*   Once the cakes are completely cool, frost as desired.

**Important Notes and Tips:**

*   **Room Temperature Ingredients:** Using room temperature ingredients, especially butter, eggs, and buttermilk, is crucial for a smooth batter and even baking. Room temperature ingredients emulsify better, creating a more stable and lighter cake.
*   **Don't Overmix:** Overmixing develops gluten, resulting in a tough cake. Mix until just combined after adding the dry ingredients.
*   **Even Baking:** Make sure your oven is properly calibrated.  Oven thermometers are inexpensive and helpful. Rotating the cakes halfway through baking can also help ensure even browning.
*   **Cooling Completely:** Frosting a warm cake will melt the frosting.  Be patient and let the cakes cool completely.

**Dietary Adaptations:**

*   **Gluten-Free:** Substitute the all-purpose flour with a good quality gluten-free all-purpose flour blend that contains xanthan gum.  Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour or King Arthur Gluten-Free Measure for Measure Flour are good choices.
*   **Dairy-Free:**
    *   Substitute the butter with a vegan butter alternative.  Make sure it's a baking-specific one for best results.
    *   Substitute the buttermilk with a dairy-free buttermilk: Combine 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or apple cider vinegar with enough dairy-free milk (almond, soy, oat) to equal 1 cup.  Let it sit for 5 minutes to curdle slightly.
    *   Use a dairy-free butter alternative for the frosting and dairy-free milk or cream.
*   **Lower Sugar:**  This is tricky with cake because sugar contributes to both sweetness and structure. You can try reducing the sugar by 1/4 cup, but it might affect the texture slightly.  Consider adding a sugar-free vanilla extract or a pinch of stevia to compensate for the sweetness. Be careful not to add too much stevia or other sugar substitutes, as they can sometimes have an aftertaste.

**Buttermilk Substitute:** If you don't have buttermilk, you can make a quick substitute: Combine 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice with enough milk (regular or non-dairy) to equal 1 cup. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using.

**Flavor Variations:**

*   **Lemon Cake:** Add the zest of one lemon to the batter and substitute lemon juice for half of the buttermilk.
*   **Chocolate Cake:**  Add 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder to the dry ingredients.
*   **Almond Cake:** Substitute almond extract for the vanilla extract.
